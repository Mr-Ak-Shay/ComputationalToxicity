# ComputationalToxicity

Hey!
The EGNNtesting.ipynb is still under progress, working on it for better final logs.
You can find the final Log results of 6 GNN Architectures at "Final_logs.txt".
All the 6 models are in their saved in their respective .pth files.
You can also find the plotted graph of PCA & t-SNE of the molecular graphs in "pca_tsne_visualizations.png".
The Models training loop and thier architecture are present in "ModelEvals1.ipynb" and "ModelEvals2.ipynb".

We are yet to implement more GNN architectures, along with thier Training & Validation Loss graphs for each model to test its effeciency.
We are still trying to improve this on a large-scale, for real-world impact on the realm of Computational Toxicology.

More directed Predictions along with SHAP & LIME implementation for more personalised results through the Streamlit/Django Framework, along with Bio-Medical LLM to cater to personalised Clinical Messages for Patients.
